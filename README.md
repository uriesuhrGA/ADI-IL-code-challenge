# Android™ Development Immersive: Instructional Lead Code Challenge

Thanks for your interest in becoming an Instructional Lead for General Assembly's Android Development course! The following code challenge is designed to test your ability to build a simple grocery list app from scratch. Please build an app to the below specifications:

## Grocery List App: Technical Specs

The app must have two main Activities: a grocery list, and an edit item detail Activity. Both activities must accomplish the following user goals:

**Grocery list Activity**
* View all of my groceries in a single list
* Check off groceries that I have purchased
* Tap an item on my list for more details
* Add new items to my list

**Edit Item Detail Activity**
* Add the name of a new item
* Add a short description for each item
* Edit the quantity of the item
* Delete an item

Your app must be built in [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and also follow Google's [Material Design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

Once you’ve completed your app, please push your project file up to GitHub and email the link to your repo to [urie.suhr@ga.co](urie.suhr@ga.co) and [mehan@ga.co](mehan@ga.co).
